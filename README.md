2) Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3) Run `npm start` to run the application localhost.
4) Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Technologies
I've decided to create this app using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) because its is a well known library for building user interfaces, with a strong support and development community.
